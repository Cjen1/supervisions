- Network Layer
 - What is the purpose of this layer?
 - Define simplex and duplex
 - What is the difference between the data plane and the control plane
  - Why is this separation also useful in other contexts (for example distributed databases)?
 - What is the line rate of a switch
 - What is a border or edge router?
 - Routing table
  - What is this
  - Why does this allow the router to make fast forwarding decisions?
  - Why is address fragmentation problematic for this table?
   - How does IPv6 address this?
 - What is an autonomous System
 - What famous general problem is calculating routes equivalent to?
 - Outline and compare Distance Vector and Link State routing
  - Give the conceptual outline of each
  - Under what condition is Link State routing better?
  - Why does the Distance Vector routing break down?
  - Find an example of BGP route advertisement resulting in a large proportion of internet traffic being routed via a single AS
 - Describe a packets traversal through a router
 - What is longest prefix matching and why does that result in 'optimal' delivery
 - Describe each part of an IPv4 packet
 - Why is the protocol specified within the packet header?
 - Why is ip fragmentation required?
 - Outline how to fragment a packet
 - What addresses are in the following subnet: 192.168.16.0/23
 - DHCP
  - What is it meant to do?
  - Outline the protocol
 - What is a NAT
  - Why is this required for legacy IPv4 networks?
  - Why might some say that it improves the security of the system?
  - Why does it pose difficulty with for example self hosted services (like game servers, or email servers)
  - (optional) outline nat punch-through and discuss why it is beneficial for applications like Skype
 - What are ICMP messages?
 - Discuss IPv4 ARP
 - Why does soft state result in robustness?
 - IPv6
  - Outline an IPv6 header
  - Outline IPv6 packet fragmentation
  - Outline an IPv6 address structure
   - Why does this make routing easier?
  - What do the following addresses mean:
   - fe80::/10
   - ::1
   - fc00::/7
   - 2000::/3
   - ff00::/8
  - What is IPv6 neighbor discovery
  - Outline SLAAC
   - What is its purpose
  - What are router advertisements?
  - Discuss 6to4 tunnels
  - (optional) Outline possible reasons why after 20 years Virgin media still doesn't offer IPv6 to residential addresses
   - Also note that they service a larger number of properties than they have address space.
