- Transport layer
 - What is it?
 - What are ports at the transport layer?
 - Why does this make running duplicate services from the same ip address difficult?
 - Why does the transport need to mux/demultiplex IP streams?
 - UDP
  - Outline UDP
  - What guarantees does this provide?
  - Outline some C/pseudocode (but valid POSIX commands) code for a basic echo server
 - TCP
  - What is the purpose of TCP
  - How does it provide reliable delivery?
  - Outline sequence numbers for reliable delivery
  - Outline cumulative and selective acknowledgements
  - Outline sliding windows
  - Outline TCP :)
   - Discuss the abstraction
   - Discuss segmentation
    - Why is it required
    - How does it work
   - What are TCP sequence numbers?
   - Outline what happens when packets are lost
   - How does TCP choose a retransmission timeout?
   - How a connection is established
   - How a connection is torn down under normal circumstances
   - What is the purpose of RST
   - Flow control
    - Why is this needed for the receiver
   - Congestion control
    - Why is this needed?
    - At a high level how does it achieve this (in terms of what is it estimating, and what additional considerations apply)
    - Discuss approaches and why all of them are terrible :)
     - Don't care
     - Explicit reservation
     - Pricing
     - Dynamic adjustments
    - Why does dynamic adjustment require cooperation (and why might a company like google cause a tragedy of the commons by 'optimising' their TCP congestion control)
    - What signal is used to backoff?
    - Where does the sawtooth come from?
    - What phases are there to the standard algorithm
    - What is Fast Recovery
  - What are TCP's flavors
  - How can routers help TCP congestion problems?
   - Outline Max-Min Fairness
   - Outline fair queuing
   - (optional) Outline stocastic fair queueing (sfq) as implemented in Linux
  - Outline some general 'fairness' qualities and discuss under what circumstances each might be optimal
