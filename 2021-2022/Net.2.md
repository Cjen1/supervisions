# Supervision 2

- Protocols
  - How do they get standardised?
  - Layering
    - Downside of layering
    - What is a cross layer violation
  - What are end to end guarantees
    - Why might multiple interpretions of this principle be negative?
  
- Physical Layer
  - What is it?
  - What is analogue and digital
    - How can we convert from one to the other? (don't go too deep on this)
  - Define bandwidth in the context of analogue signals
  - What is noise in analogue signals, and where does it come from
  - What is a self clocking signal?
  - Define manchester coding
    - Why is it useful?
  - What does interference look like for example on the signal: [1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1] and [-1,1,1,-1,1,-1,-1]
  - How do we use CDMA to allow multiple signals to be transmitted on the same wire/airwaves
  - What is error detection
    - Outline parity checks
    - Outline CRC codes
  - What is forward error correction
  
- Data Link Layer
  - What is it?
  - Define Broadcast links
  - Define Point to Point links
  - what is a collision?
  - Channel Partitioning
    - Discuss TDMA, FDMA
  - Taking turns
    - Discuss: Polling, Token rings
  - Random Access
    - Discuss: CSMA, CSMA/CD
    - Discuss Random exponetial backoff
  - Outline Ethernet
  - Outline 802.11
  - What is the problem with: 
    - hidden terminals?
    - exposed terminals
  - What is rts and cts?

  - What is a MAC address?
  - What is a self learning switch?
  - What is flooding (and what is the problem?)
    - How do we fix this?
  - How can we construct a spanning tree for a ethernet style network?
